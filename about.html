        <div class="paragraph-about1">
            <p><b>DISNEY SPEEDSTORM</b> is a free-to-play kart racing game with a roster composed of characters from various Disney properties, such as the Mickey and Friends, Pirates of the Caribbean, Monsters, Inc., Toy Story and Beauty and the Beast franchises, among others, and more. Reimagined as race car drivers (referred to in-game as "Racers") in an in-universe arcade game also called Disney Speedstorm.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The gameplay is similar to Mario Kart. Racers can drift to improve their cornering and charge their nitro boost, which can only be used when the boost meter full. Racers also get a small drift boost from long drifts (indicated by their tires glowing blue), which also gives them an extra boost charge. Racers can sideswipe other Racers to knock them aside, jump to reach higher grounds or dodge obstacles, perform aerial stunts off designated jumps for a small speed boost upon landing, and grind on designated blue rails to also gain nitro boost.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Racers can also pick up various power-ups, called "skills", by driving through sprites with the image of Arbee, the game's emotive AI mascot, on them. These skills include offensive weapons that stun Racers, shields that protect Racers from stuns, cloaks that make Racers intangible and invisible, nitro boost charges, rushes that provide sudden bursts of speed, and hacks that flip a Racer's screen, potentially confusing them. Skills can also be "charged" to cause different effects; for example, a charged shield allows a Racer to stun another Racer who drives into them, at the cost of not being protected from being stunned unless a normal shield, a cloak, or an invulnerability effect is already in effect. Offensive skills and hacks can also be used backwards behind Racers. The availability of the various skills depends on the Racer (except in "Single Skill" races, mentioned below); for example, some Racers can receive and use shields while others can receive and use cloaks. Finally, each Racer has a unique skill that provide benefits to only that Racer, with each unique skill having normal and charged variants.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Each Racer has a range of stats that affect their performance, including top speed, acceleration, handling, boost, and combat. The stats can be upgraded by levelling up Racers, which during the game's first six seasons of content updates, required spending various "upgrade parts" collected from single-player event races and PvP multiplayer, which were later replaced with a single currency called "upgrade coins" from the seventh season onwards. However, Racer upgrade levels are capped to certain levels depending on their star levels, which require collecting "Racer shards". Further stat boosts and other enhancements are provided by attaching "Crew Members" to a Racer, which feature images of various minor Disney characters on them. The Crew Members can only be applied to Racers of the same affiliated collections (franchises) as them, such as the Orange Bird serving as a Crew Member for Figment; with "Epic" rarity Crew Members being applicable to only one Racer.</p>
